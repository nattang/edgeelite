# Problem Statement: AI for Everyone, Everywhere

Qualcomm Intern HaQathon: EdgeElite  

## Current Reality
Today's digital experiences often fall short of being truly inclusive, responsive, or accessible across diverse environments. Users in schools, libraries, homes, and offices face challenges such as:
1. Limited access to personalized, intelligent tools  
2. Overreliance on cloud connectivity for basic AI functions  
3. Gaps in accessibility and usability for different user groups  
4. Privacy concerns with cloud-based data processing fileciteturn5file1

## The Opportunity
Qualcomm’s on-device AI capabilities unlock a new frontier for creating intuitive, secure, and responsive applications. With the power of Snapdragon platforms, you can:
1. Deliver real-time AI experiences without relying on the cloud  
2. Enhance privacy by keeping data local to the device  
3. Enable offline functionality for broader accessibility  
4. Tailor experiences to individual users through localized learning  
5. Build inclusive tools that serve a wide range of needs and environments fileciteturn5file1

## Desired Future State
